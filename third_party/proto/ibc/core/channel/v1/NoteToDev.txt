When building the enclave we pull in multiple files named upgrade.proto which results in 
overwriting the generated upgrade.rs file.
In an attempt to resolve this naming collision we chose to rename ibc/channel/v1/upgrade.proto
to channel_upgrade.proto and modify tx.proto and query.proto to point to channel_upgrade.proto

In future upgrades we may have to do the same.
