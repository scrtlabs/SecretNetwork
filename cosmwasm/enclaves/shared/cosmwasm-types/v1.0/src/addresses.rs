/// This type represents a validated address. It can be created in the following ways
/// 1. Use `Addr::unchecked(input)`
/// 2. Use `let checked: Addr = deps.api.addr_validate(input)?`
/// 3. Use `let checked: Addr = deps.api.addr_humanize(canonical_addr)?`
/// 4. Deserialize from JSON. This must only be done from JSON that was validated before
///    such as a contract's state. `Addr` must not be used in messages sent by the user
///    because this would result in unvalidated instances.
///
/// This type is immutable. If you really need to mutate it (Really? Are you sure?), create
/// a mutable copy using `let mut mutable = Addr::to_string()` and operate on that `String`
/// instance.
