  "description": "MigrateMsg allows a priviledged contract administrator to run a migration on the contract. In this (demo) case it is just migrating from one hackatom code to the same code, but taking advantage of the migration step to set a new validator.\n\nNote that the contract doesn't enforce permissions here, this is done by blockchain logic (in the future by blockchain governance)",
