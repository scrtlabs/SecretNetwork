# Burner Contract

This is a simple contract to demonstrate using migrations to shutdown (or
"burn") contracts using the migration feature added in CosmWasm 0.9.

This contract cannot be installed directly (via `instantiate`), but is only
designed to be used for `migrate`. When migrating any existing contract to this
burner contract, we delete all storage and send all bank tokens to a specified
address, doing a basic cleanup of the contract.

You can use this contract as-is, or fork it and customize it more if you want to
do more detailed cleanup.
