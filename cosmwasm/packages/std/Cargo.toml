default = []
# iterator allows us to iterate over all DB items in a given range
# optional as some merkle stores (like tries) don't support this
# given Ethereum 1.0, 2.0, Substrate, and other major projects use Tries
# we keep this optional, to allow possible future integration (or different Cosmos Backends)
iterator = []
# staking exposes bindings to a required staking moudle in the runtime, via new
# CosmosMsg types, and new QueryRequest types. This should only be enabled on contracts
# that require these types, so other contracts can be used on systems with eg. PoA consensus
staking = []
# backtraces provides much better context at runtime errors (in non-wasm code)
# at the cost of a bit of code size and performance.
backtraces = ["snafu/backtraces"]
# Debug prints enable printing log messages to the logging system of the enclave
# from inside your contract. This will only work in enclaves compiled in SW mode
# and loading the contract for execution will fail if this is used a HW mode
# enclave. This is done in order to provent leaking secrets in production.
