# Secret Network v1.9 SecretVRF Upgrade

This proposal recommends that the chain undergo a software upgrade to version v1.9 of the Secret Network codebase on secret-4 block **8,861,800**. The estimated time for the upgrade is **Tuesday, May 16, 2023, at ~2pm UTC**.

Since block times can vary significantly, we advise monitoring the chain for a more precise upgrade time. ETA monitor: [mintscan.io/secret/blocks/8861800](https://www.mintscan.io/secret/blocks/8861800).

## Upgrade Highlights

- New Feature: SecretVRF
  - Randomness injection for secret contracts.
  - `env.block.random` is now available in contracts.
  - Eliminates the need for contracts to bootstrap their own entropy pool.
  - Unique for every contract call.
  - Useful in lotteries, gaming, secure authentication protocols, protocols where unpredictable outcomes are essential for fairness and security, and much more.
  - For more information on how to use this feature, see the docs [here](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/development-concepts/secret-vrf-on-chain-randomness) and example contracts [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/random-ibc-example)
- New Feature: `FinalizeTx`.
  - `CosmosMsg::FinalizeTx` is now available as an output message in contracts.
  - Contracts can force the transaction to finalize at a certain point, otherwise revert.
  - Example: protect against sandwich attacks and potential transaction rollbacks.
  - Example: protect against cheating in gaming applications, where a malicious player could try to rollback a transaction in which they lost.
  - See Usage example [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/blob/a3edd6669/cosmwasm/contracts/v1/compute-tests/test-compute-contract/src/contract.rs#L359)
- IBC: Updated ibc-go from v3.4.0 to v4.3.0.
- New IBC Feature: Added the packet-forward-middleware (PFM) by Strangelove.
  - Other chains would be able to more easily route SCRT in the interchain. For example, sending SCRT from Osmosis to Hub now becomes a single transaction from `Osmosis -> Secret` rather than a transaction from `Osmosis -> Secret`, then a transaction from `Secret -> Hub`.
  - See Usage example [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js/blob/002c369/test/ibc.test.ts#L732-L738)
- New IBC Feature: Added IBC Fee middleware.
  - Creates a fee market for relaying IBC packets.
  - Adds four new message types: `MsgPayPacketFee`, `MsgPayPacketFeeAsync`, `MsgRegisterCounterpartyPayee` and `MsgRegisterPayee`.
  - `MsgPayPacketFee` can be used to pay a fee for relaying an IBC packet. In a transaction, it must come before the IBC packet is sent. See example [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js/blob/002c369/test/ibc.test.ts#L976-L995).
  - `MsgPayPacketFeeAsync` can be used to pay a fee for an IBC packet that was already sent. It must come before the packet's `MsgRecvPacket` is processed on the receiving chain.
  - `MsgRegisterCounterpartyPayee` is used by relayers to register their payee on chain A for submitting `MsgRecvPacket` on chain B. This is a required one-time setup for each channel on both chains, as fees are paid on the sending chain only. See example [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js/blob/002c369/test/ibc.test.ts#L834-L840)
  - `MsgRegisterPayee` is used by relayers to change their default payee on chain A for submitting `MsgAcknowledgement` and `MsgTimeout` on chain A. The default payee on chain A is the relayer's address. See example [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret.js/blob/002c369/test/ibc.test.ts#L846-L853).
- New IBC Feature: Added IBC panic button.
  - Quickly shuts down IBC in case of an emergency.
  - Delegates the ability to shut down IBC to a single address, which is intended to be a multisig of various stakeholders in the network.
  - This feature is turned off by default and can be turned on by a future param change proposal that also determines the account address that can shut down IBC.
- New Feature: Evaporate & Check Gas APIs by [@darwinzer0](https://github.com/darwinzer0) & [blake-regalia](https://github.com/blake-regalia)
  - `deps.api.gas_evaporate(amount)` & `deps.api.check_gas()` are now available in contracts.
  - Allows contract developers to create contracts that consume a constant amount of gas, independently of their code path. This
  - Helps harden contracts against information leakage from the amount of gas consumed by a contract.
  - See usage examples [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/blob/a3edd6669/cosmwasm/contracts/v1/compute-tests/evaporation/src/contract.rs#L16-L39).
- Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where nodes would sometimes stop if failing to enter SGX enclave.
