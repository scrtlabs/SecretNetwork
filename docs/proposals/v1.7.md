This proposal proposes that the chain elect to do a software upgrade to the v1.6 software version of the Secret Network codebase on block **TODO**, which is estimated to occur on **Wednesday, March 1, 2023 at 2:00PM UTC**. Block times have high variance, so please monitor the chain for more precise time estimates. ETA monitor can be found at [mintscan.io/secret/blocks/TODO](https://www.mintscan.io/secret/blocks/6537300).

## Upgrade Highlights

### New Features

- Added the ability to rotate consensus seed during a network upgrade - this will be executed during this upgrade
- Added expedited gov proposals
  - Initial params (can be amended with a param change proposal):
    - Minimum deposit: 750 SCRT
    - Voting time: 24 hours
    - Voting treshhold: 2/3 yes to pass
  - If an expedited proposal fails to meet the threshold within the scope of shorter voting duration, it's then converted to a regular proposal and restarts voting under regular voting conditions.
- Added auto-restaking - an opt-in feature that enables automatic compounding of staking rewards
- Added light-client validation for blocks
  - Protects against leaking private data using an offline fork attack
  - Enables trusted block heights and block time to be relied on by contracts

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed OSX Ledger disconnection issues in secretcli
- Fixed /cosmos/base/node/v1beta1/config
- Fixed an issue when sending multiple message types in the same tx
- Fixed an issue with the IBC controller module

### Breaking Changes

Mandatory secret.js update (non-API breaking).

To implement consensus seed rotation, the tx encryption key format has changed, requiring an update of secret.js. After the upgrade goes live, secret.js will require an update to one of the following versions to continue to function:

- v1.5.x, v1.6.x -> v1.7.x
- v1.4.x -> v1.4.6
- v0.17.8 - can still be used

This should be a simple version bump that will not change any existing APIs, and will not break functionality. In order to test this version, secret.js v1.7.1-beta3 is available for testing on pulsar-2, which is already on the 1.7 update.

Side note: This upgrade will not affect Keplr
