## Building Secret Apps with SecretJS

A Secret App is a decentralized application with computational and data privacy. Secret Apps are usually comprised of the following components:

- A Secret Contract deployed on the Secret Network
- A frontend app built with a JavaScript framework (e.g. ReactJS, VueJS, AngularJS, etc.) connected to the Secret Network using SecretJS
- SecretJS interacting with a REST API exposed by nodes in the Secret Network. The REST API/HTTPS server is commonly referred to as LCD Server (Light Client Daemon). Usually by connecting SecretJS with a wallet, the wallet handles interactions with the LCD server.
