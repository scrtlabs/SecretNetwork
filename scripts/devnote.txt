How to deploy dev test net

Create a bootstrap node
export SCRT_CHAINID=secretdev-1
export SCRT_MONIKER=scrt
export SGX_MODE=SW
and run ./scripts/start_bootstrap_node.sh
You will need to run: secretd tendermint show-node-id
Note the bootstrap node IP. Make sure the ports for 26656 snd 26657 are open and the machine is reachable
On full nodes: secretd tendermint show-node-id 
export SCRT_CHAINID=secretdev-1
export SCRT_MONIKER=scrt
export SGX_MODE=SW
export SCRT_BOOTSTRAP=<bootstrap IP>
export SCRT_BOOTSTRAP_NODE_ID=<bootstrap node id>

Start full node by running: ./scripts/start_full_node.sh

If you want to add this node as a validator:
export keys a,b,c,d --recover [will need mnemonics]

Add node as validator: ./scripts/add_validator.sh
